## Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:
### What are your learning goals for this project?
LL: Better acquainted with array prototypes, and keep my consistent sleep schedule through the weekend.  Allow partner to lead the way by driving more.
MR: Better comfort with jQuery. Do more driving
### What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
LL: Driver/navigator best, but open to other forms of approaches.
MR: same
### How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
LL: face to face, open and kind. Open to slack and text and phone as well.
MR:  appreciates open communication best. Verbal 
### How would you describe your work style?
LL: methodical
MR: I spend a lot of time internalizing new concepts before I'm able to talk about them.  I hope to feel more comfortable diving into unknown coding territory.
### What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
LL: basic human needs not being attended to, creating frustration and hangry behavior.
MR: I have had communication problems in one of my paired projects, but feel I have improved.  In my last pairing I really liked how we worked together most of the time and divided up small tasks to do individually.
### What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
LL: exercise and tea.  clarity.
MR: When I am unsure of how to proceed, it helps me to be around groups to bounce ideas off of.  
### What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
LL: counseling Sunday from 1:30-3:30
MR: I have no scheduling restraints that I am currently aware of.  I may have an hour long appointment at sometime this weekend and will notify you of this as soon as I have more information.
### What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
LL:  honest & kind.  If emotions are visibly high, I’ll wait until a later time to have that feedback conversation.  
MR: I'm pretty easy going which sometimes prevents me from giving feedback.  
### What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
LL: I’m strong in CSS.  I could always use more reps with the js and jQuery though.  Having a look at other people’s code for this project should help with that.
MR: I finally feel like my CSS skills are developing.  Definitely not as strong in JavaScript and jQuery, but I'm really looking to learn and improve upon that.
### What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
LL: git, GitHub, css, html, js, jQuery, and ‘projects’ in GitHub for synchronicity of the workflow.
MR: Talking face to face and making lists is great. Lists help make goals and stay on task
### How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  LL: pseudo-code, code, factor, and refactor
  MR: Talk to me!
How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
LL: good ole-fashioned hours, patience with ourselves AND one another.

# Static Comp Challenge 3
## Specification
The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep you working that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate a static comp, with each growing in complexity. For each challenge, you’ll be given a static comp and asked to recreate it. Don’t worry, we’ll give you a bit of creative license, however the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design. Once you get into the workforce - building out comps that reflect the designer’s choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail is a requirement.

## Things to Note
We have not provided you with any assets, nor native files. You will have to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines below.
We have not provided breakpoint specific comps. You will need to employ some creativity here with a heavy dose of good judgment. Think about how you, as a user, could best experience the content/layout across various screen sizes. Is the content legible? Does the imagery (especially full bleed background images) still make sense and look good? Do portions of the nav become icons (and are they intuitive?), or a menu?
## Creative License
You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes:

Copy
Images
Icons
Color palette, but ONLY if you select a complementary palette. We highly encourage you to visit sites like: material palette or coolors or color-hex
## Base Requirements
Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
Site must be responsive
Create a repo on github :octocat: for your work with following naming construct: [initials]-comp-challenge-[challenge number] (i.e. “bt-comp-challenge-1”)
Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
Push your final work to github pages
Additional Requirements
This final challenge is a part of your portfolio
Note the rubric below for evaluation criteria
PRO-TIP
This is layout that takes a good amount of time to build. Don’t wait until Monday of week 6 to get started.

## HTML
Accessibility
# Novice	
Knows what a semantic tag is and leverages the HTML5 structural tags to organize the content of their markup.
# Advanced Beginner	
Leverages more precise semantic tags when applicable, and employs basic ARIA roles attributes for added clarity in structure, descriptive image alt attributes, title attributes for applicable anchor tags.
# Proficient	
Employs detailed accessibility practices throughout markup, especially in forms and can speak to decisions made in accessibility choices as it relates to specific accessibility concerns.
# Exceptional	
Can run markup through a variety of online accessibility tools and score well for content, color, screen readers, etc.
## Style
# Novice	
Crafts markup with proper indentation and opening/closing tags.
# Advanced Beginner	
Crafts markup with proper and logical nesting.
Proficient	Crafts lean, efficient markup that is easy to read and follow across naming conventions, structure, and solid formatting that follows industry best practices.
Exceptional	Crafts lean, efficient markup and can speak directly to choices made to improve performance, including but not limited to, page load times, css/js optimizations, image optimizations.


## CSS
## Structure of Code
# Novice	 
Can effectively target DOM elements via tag, class, and/or id and write CSS rules around each element to create the desired style.
# Advanced Beginner	
Can cleanly and logically organize CSS rules according to similar categories (i.e. typography, layout, components), and then logically organize the remaining CSS rules based on flow of the markup. Organizes properties within rules alphabetically.
# Proficient	
Leverages cascading styles and CSS specificity rules to create more complex targeting of elements in order to reduce, reuse, share styles across elements. Organizes properties within rules based upon industry standard principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS.
# Exceptional	
Understands the performance implications surrounding cascading/specificity and crafts CSS that is mindful of reducing complexity and increasing performance.
## Implementation
# Novice	
Can articulate how the CSS box model works and apply it appropriately in a static layout.
# Advanced Beginner	
Can articulate the differences between the approaches of absolute/relative positioning, flex-box, floats, and can appropriately apply the approaches to solve a variety of layout problems.
# Proficient	
Develops layouts that work cross-browser, are responsive, and can logically defend the choices made in implementation approach for layout.
# Exceptional	
Can articulate rationale for all parts of the CSS implementation (each line of code/CSS rule) specifically in regards to the balance of: structure of code, design integrity, performance.


## DESIGN
# Comp Recreation
# Novice	
Can establish a complementary color palette, integrate font(s), and execute a handful of the large comp details.
# Advanced Beginner	
Can accomplish about 50-75% of the large and small design details and can logically rework them on at least 1 breakpoint.
# Proficient
Developer captures the spirit and design intent of the comp. Some small details need polish to achieve a pixel-perfect match to the comp, but developer is clearly mindful of details and has made a conscious and careful effort to match the comp. Any design decisions left open to interpretation are handled thoughtfully and are well executed, but are more noticable and/or unintuative than they would be if the designer had provided the solution, or may not be totally seamless during screen-size transitions.
# Exceptional	
Developer skillfully captures the spirit and design intent of all comp details. Execution is pixel-perfect and any design decisions left open to interpretation are solved intentionally, are as seamless as if the designer had provided the solution, are handled gracefully, and enhance the overall design.
## Design Concepts
# Novice	
Can integrate typography, color choices, and layout in ways that do not detract from legibility.
# Advanced Beginner	
Can apply fundamental design concepts with increased sensitivity that result in clear legibility but likely break in areas of responsiveness, layout, “noise”.
# Proficient	
Can apply fundamental design concepts in a comp that demonstrates a thoughtful, purposeful, cohesive strategy that does not detract from legibility or overall design integrity.
# Exceptional	
Typography, color choices, and layout decisions are thoughtful and appropriate, and strongly enhance the layout and legibility of the design.
